# FileSystemCompositePattern

This project demonstrates the Composite Design Pattern using a File System simulation. It shows how individual objects (files) and composite objects (folders) can be treated uniformly under a common interface, enabling tree-like structures to be traversed and managed seamlessly. Perfect for understanding how to work with hierarchical data structures in a clean, maintainable way.
